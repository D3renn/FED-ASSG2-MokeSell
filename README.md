# MokeSell

- FED Assignment 2
-This is part of a Front End Development Assignment.

-This is a second-hand marketplace for users to buy and/or sell their items to other users.

-MokeSell provides a variety of items to select from such as shoes, shirts and many more.
 
## Design Process
 
We took inspirations from marketplace websites such as Ebay, Carousell and Nike. Among these websites, we identified and took inspiration from certain aspects we liked to provide a simple yet exclusive feeling while they browse the marketpalce. We chose a colour palette similar to Nike as we wanted to give the users a slightly more smooth and premium feel when using the platform. We chose a layout similar to Carousell as we wanted to give the users a simplistic interface so that the UX will make sense and they logically know how to navigate.
